# Multithreading
Thread: an executable unit to perform a task.
in a single core system, there is a time scheduling for serving multiple threads. 
Time is divided between threads and the operating system sends in succession a certain number of instructions from each thread 
to the processor for execution. The threads may share some resources in the system.
A race and ambiguous condition might occur when two or more threads use a common resource. Mutex, Locks and Semaphores are synchronization tools 
for managing resources between threads.
