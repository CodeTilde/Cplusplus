This folder contains programs for producing scheduling alerts and notifications.
A multithreading approach has been used. 
join() waits until thread function returns. A thread function having  
while (1)
{
}
waits for ever. 
Without using join for a thread,  the main/current thread completes its excution while the created thread is still running (run time error).
